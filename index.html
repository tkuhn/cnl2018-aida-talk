<h3>AIDA Approach</h3>
<p><span class="cem2">We introduced the approach of <strong>AIDA Sentences</strong> in earlier work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled Natural Language</li>
<li>English sentences that are <span class="cem">Atomic, Independent, Declarative, and Absolute</span></li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h3>AIDA Sentence: <span class="cem2">Definition</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="cem">Atomic:</span> a sentence describing one thought that cannot be further broken down in a practical way</li>
<li><span class="cem">Independent:</span> a sentence that can stand on its own, without external references like "this effect" or "we"</li>
<li><span class="cem">Declarative:</span> a complete sentence ending with a full stop that could (at least in theory) be true or false</li>
<li><span class="cem">Absolute:</span> a sentence describing the core of a claim ignoring the (un)certainty about its truth and ignoring how it was discovered (without "probably" or "evaluation showed that")</li>
</ul>

<h3>AIDA Sentences: <span class="cem">Examples</span></h3>
"A combination of system and searcher biases lead search engine users to settle on the incorrect answer to yes/no-questions around half of the time."<br>
<small>(from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2484028.2484053">10.1145/2484028.2484053</a>)</small>
<br>
"Teenagers reply on average faster to emails than adults.''<br>

"Deep learning is a powerful and accurate method for automatic speech recognition.''<br>

<h3>Related Controlled Natural Languages</h3>
<p><span class="cem">Basic English (~1930):</span> designed to improve <span class="cem2">human communication</span> in politics, economy, and <span class="cem2">science</span>.</p>
<p>Other CNLs (ACE, CLEF) proposed for scientific results: <span class="cem">focus on precision</span></p>
<p>AIDA is unique as a <span class="cem2">CNL for knowledge representation that focuses on expressivity</span> instead of precision.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<p><span class="cem">About AIDA sentences:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How easily can researchers write them?</li>
<li>How easily can they be automatically extracted?</li>
<li><span class="cem2">Are they really general and cover everything?</span></li>
<li><span class="cem2">Do researchers like them?</span></li>
<li><span class="cem2">Can they be easily linked and formalized?</span></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Previous Studies</h3>
<p>First study on <span class="cem">manual creation</span> of AIDA sentences from abstracts by <span class="cem2">untrained researchers</span></p>
<p>Second study on <span class="cem">automatic creation</span> of AIDA sentences from abstracts with a <span class="cem2">simple algorithm</span></p>
<p>In both studies, about <span class="cem2">70%</span> of the created AIDA sentences were <span class="cem2">perfectly accurate</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Cochrane Library report on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005593">"Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease"</a></li>
<li>Summarizes evidence and findings from various publications on the topic</li>
<li>Led to 62 AIDA sentences</li>

<li>On <a href="https://sparceurope.org/what-we-do/open-access/sparc-europe-open-access-resources/open-access-citation-advantage-service-oaca/">Open Access citation advantage</a></li>
<li>General AIDA sentence: <span class="cem">"Open Access publications receive on average more citations than similar publications that are not Open Access."</span></li>
<li>More specific ones, e.g. "Open Access publications <span class="cem2">in astronomy and physics</span> receive ..."</li>
