<h3>How can we Get such Networks of Results and Knowledge?</h3>
<p><span class="cem2">Communicating scientific findings in a way that</span></p>
<ul>
<li>allows for <span class="cem">machine-interpretable</span> representations (as compared to narrative papers in English)</li>
<li>is <span class="cem">general</span> (i.e. applies to all of science, and possibly beyond)</li>
<li>is <span class="cem">simple and intuitive</span> (i.e. doesn't require a background in formal methods to be used)</li>
<li>is <span class="cem">flexible</span> in the sense that formal, semi-formal, and informal statements are supported</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h3>AIDA Approach</h3>
<p><span class="cem2">We introduced the approach of <strong>AIDA Sentences</strong> in earlier work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled Natural Language</li>
<li>English sentences that are <span class="cem">Atomic, Independent, Declarative, and Absolute</span></li>
<li>PENS type: P<sup>2</sup>E<sup>5</sup>N<sup>4</sup>S<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>AIDA Sentence: Definition</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="cem">Atomic:</span> a sentence describing one thought that cannot be further broken down in a practical way</li>
<li><span class="cem">Independent:</span> a sentence that can stand on its own, without external references like "this effect" or "we"</li>
<li><span class="cem">Declarative:</span> a complete sentence ending with a full stop that could (at least in theory) be true or false</li>
<li><span class="cem">Absolute:</span> a sentence describing the core of a claim ignoring the (un)certainty about its truth and ignoring how it was discovered (without phrases such as "probably" or "evaluation showed that"</li>
</ul>

<h3>AIDA Sentences: Examples</h3>
"A combination of system and searcher biases lead search engine users to settle on the incorrect answer to yes/no-questions around half of the time."<br>
